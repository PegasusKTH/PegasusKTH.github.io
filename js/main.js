// TODO: SearchBox intergration needed in var listIntegration. @param courseCode for nodifyLookupMAIN
/*
	This file takes a Course Code from index.html searching functionality and builds a tree

	1.	NodifyLookupMAIN takes a course code and returns all information in a jsonObject
	2.	A tree is recursivly built with buildTree and saved in listintegration where
		each node has information about:
			courseCode
			prerequisites
			courseURL = "https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/" + courseCode;
			parentNode
			_json_id
	3.	The tree in listIntegration is traversed row by row with BFS and gets assigned
		and unique ID for each node in the tree. That is needed for the Treant library.
	4.	nodestructure is a jsonObject used by Treant and is created and formated
		by exportTree.
	5.	Treant uses simple_chart_config that is the "config" concatenated with the
		"nodestructure" and visually shows the tree.
